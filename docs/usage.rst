Direct Factory & Reactor Usage
------------------------------

twistd & the mllp plugin are not required. You are able to directly start a
twisted reactor or application, instantiating the,
:py:class:`txHL7.mllp.MLLPFactory` passing into it an instance of an
:py:class:`txHL7.receiver.IHL7Receiver`::

    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from txHL7.mllp import MLLPFactory
    from myreceiver import Receiver

    def run(port):
        receiver = Receiver()
        factory = MLLPFactory(receiver)

        reactor = get_reactor()
        reactor.listenTCP(port, factory)
        reactor.run()

    run(6666)
